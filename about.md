Hi there! I'm Sonya (aka Sox), a Fullstack Ed. Dev. in the making!

### More Information

I've just completed a 12 Week WebDev Bootcamp with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive). 12 weeks of coding all day and all night using Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Javascript, Backbone, jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5. 

Check out my [P O R T F O L I O](http://soxface.github.io/portfolio).

Feel free to tweet me about EdTech, Health, Roller Derby and Code.
