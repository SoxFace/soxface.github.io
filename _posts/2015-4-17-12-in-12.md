title: 12 Rails Apps in 12 Days
---

So where are all my commits coming from? Obviously this blog but I'm doing other learnings to keep up with my #gitgreenstreak...

I found [Mackenzie Child's 12-in-12 Challenge](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/), where he build 12 Ruby on Rails apps in 12 weeks. He's a front-end guy doing a stellar job learning backend things and he's screencasting his way to glory. So far this week I've watched and built the following apps:

- [Reddit Clone (68mins)](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/1/)
- [Jobs Board (46mins)](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/7/)
- [Forum] (97mins)(https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/10/)

I also just learned about [The Australian Federation] (http://dashboard.aaf.edu.au/) a framework and support infrastructure to facilitate trusted electronic communications and collaboration within and between universities and research institutions in Australia. So I'll be doing a bit of digging around in there this weekend too...
