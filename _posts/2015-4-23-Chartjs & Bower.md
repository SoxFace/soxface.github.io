title: Chartjs & Bower
---

I've been dabbling with [Chartjs](http://www.chartjs.org/) for an upcoming project in work.

I was going to use a bootstrap admin template to display the charts and I spent a bit of time reading about bower install. I got it all setup with Rails, all thanks to this handy [blog post](http://dotwell.io/taking-advantage-of-bower-in-your-rails-4-app/). But...

...the asset pipline killed my dreams!!! No time to go looking into this further at the moment, however [Rails-Assets.org](https://rails-assets.org/) may be the answer.

I've been keeping up with my [Mackenzie Child's 12-in-12 Challenge](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/) and to date have finished:

- a blog
- a forum
- a pinterest clone
- a reddit clone
- a jobs board
- a recipe box
- a wiki
- a workout log

I really like the high repetition of churning out a bit of Ruby in rails, so I highly recommend these tutorials to anyone who wants to keep coding.
