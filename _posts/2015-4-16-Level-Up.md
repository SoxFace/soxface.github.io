title: Level Up with ThoughtWorks
---

Week One of ThoughtWorks [LevelUp](http://levelup.thoughtworks.com/) grad program is done and dusted and I could not be more excited. So far the amazing volunteers have opened our eyes to:

- test-driven development
- continuous delivery 
- pair programming 
- Agile project management
- business analysis

If you're keen to learn all of these things, signup for the next [LevelUp](http://levelup.thoughtworks.com/) now!!!

Our Green Team will be working on creating a smart watch app to help deliver educational content and games via [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) with all the relevant tests in [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

I'm super excited to get a chance to deliver a project using Backbone, so this week I had another run at completing the awesome [ToDoMVC Tutorial by Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/#exercise-1-todos---your-first-backbone.js-app).
