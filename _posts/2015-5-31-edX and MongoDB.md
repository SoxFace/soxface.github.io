How did a whole month fly by without posting!?! Who knows...

So what have I been up to?

- finishing ThoughtWorks LevelUp
-- building a BackboneJS Smartphone app
-- learning all about Agile
- setting up edX tech stack
- building courses in Instructure Canvas
- playing with [timelines in CSS](http://soxface.github.io/timeline-outcomes/)
- starting a 7 week course in [Mongo University](https://university.mongodb.com)
- taking part in my first ever Hackathon

I'll be writing more about the TW LevelUp program and the #SheHacks Hackathon - mainly as these two are where I learned the most. Stay tuned!!!
