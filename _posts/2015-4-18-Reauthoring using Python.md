title: Creating Liquid HTML
---

Working at the University of Sydney has many, many, MANY perks. The sheer quality of people you work with day in, day out is one of these many perks. One such wonder is [Abelardo Pardo](http://abelardopardo.blogspot.com.au/).

At a recent edTech talk, Aberlardo showcased his project [Reauthoring](https://bitbucket.org/abelardopardo/reauthoring), a toolkit to create Liquid HTML Active Learning Resources.

Say what!?!

Think [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) but for active learning content (read: MCQs, analytics etc...)

My initial git clone and poking around has introduced me to:

- Python
- [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)
- [Sphinx_rtd_theme](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/soxface/reauthoring)

Basically...a whole new world of interesting. Hopefully, collaborating will lead to Aberaldo realising his goal - to create Active Learning Resources in a type of a command.

In other news, these two commands were super helpful tonight:

```
brew install sphinx
```
```
git remote rm origin
```
